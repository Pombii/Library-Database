# Library-Database

This project is to simulate a simple library database. It gives the user an option to either insert a new record, print the current record by insertion, remove a record by last insertion or by title, print the database in order by earliest publishing year, and finally when the user selects exit the program will order the records by publishing year and export to an already existing .txt file
